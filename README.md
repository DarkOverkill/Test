# Node & React starter kit

This starter kit is designed to help you start project as soon as possible. It contain all necessary things to develop and maintain a project.

## Getting started

In this project we used [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/complementary-tools/#editor-plugins), so at the beginning check your code editor plugins or settings to support these linters.

You can create a new project based on node-react-starter-kit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keenethics/node-react-starter-kit.git <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Running the project:

```bash
npm start
```

## Naming conventions

We preferably use lovercase names with hyphens for file/folder and camelCase for variable names. We setup an aliases to facilitate the import of components (you can see list of aliases in webpack config) and we use names with uppercase for them.
